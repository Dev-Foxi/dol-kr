# Degrees of Lewdity Graphics Mod


***Community Update***

I've added some community updates to the img.zip file from here https://gitgud.io/Kaervek/kaervek-beeesss-community-sprite-compilation


****NOTE:****
I warn you now that I'm not very good with computers.

***PROGRESS***

I have made it to the point where I'm happy to release before I waste more time touching things up. The mod(texture pack) should be in a playable state now. Many of the clothes and body writing are just hap-hazardly nudged into place for now. There will likely be some clipping or gaps until I individually fix those. Drawing up new clothing for everything in the game would take way too long to accomplish, so I am settling for this quick fix for now.

Installing the mod is as easy as dragging and dropping the img folder into the Degrees of Lewdity folder

**INSTALLATION**

Drag and Drop the files, make sure that this mod's "img" folder replaces all the files in the game's "img" folder.

**SUPPORT**

Legally, I can't charge you for a mod but please feel free to buy some random asshole coffee.
